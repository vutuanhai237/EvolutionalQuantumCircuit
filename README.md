# Multi-target quantum compilation algorithm
 
This project aims to use GA to search for the best ansatz for some hybrid quantum-classical models such as VQA, Quantum state preparation, and Quantum state tomography. 

The structure of this repository:

- codes: include .ipynb file (main code)
- experiments: hold the result after executing the program defined in the codes folder.
- test: include test cases for CI/CD

Dependencies:
- qoop: a self-development package which is developing in another repository
- qiskit: 0.45.0
